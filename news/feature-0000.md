syslog-ng OSE APT repository

### syslog-ng OSE APT repository

From now on, Ubuntu and Debian packages will be published with every syslog-ng release in the form of an APT repository.

We, syslog-ng developers, provide these packages and the APT repository "as is" without warranty of any kind,
on a best-effort level.

Currently, syslog-ng packages are released for the following distribution versions (x86-64):
  - Debian: bullseye, buster, stretch, sid, testing
  - Ubuntu: Impish, Focal, Bionic, Xenial

For instructions on how to install syslog-ng on Debian/Ubuntu distributions, see the
[README](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/blob/master/README.md#debianubuntu).
